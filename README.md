# That Nerdy Trivia Game

Welcome to That Nerdy Trivia Game, a jQuery and timer focused demo game.

Questions are randomly selected from a trivia API via AJAX. The player can select a difficulty mode that sets the timer duration for the game. Whether answering correct, wrong , or if the time runs out a message will be displayed and after another short timer the game will retreive another question until all questions are chosen. The final game screen will display the correct and incorrect answers with an option to reset and play again by making another AJAX call for more questions.
