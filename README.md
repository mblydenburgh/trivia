# That Nerdy Trivia Game

Welcome to That Nerdy Trivia Game, a jQuery and timer focused demo game.

Questions are randomly selected from JSON data and the player has as set amount of time to choose a correct answer. Whether correct, wrong ,and the time runs out, a message will be displayed and after another short timer the game will retreive another question until all questions are chosen. The final game screen will display the correct and incorrect answers with an option to reset and play again.
